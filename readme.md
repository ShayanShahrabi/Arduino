## Introduction
Here are my Arduino projects that I've put together! I want to emphasize that I'm not a professional in this field at all; just a cheerful, curious programmer with a keen interest. So you may not find any groundbreaking projects here!

Feel free to share suggestions and contribute to my work :)

## Projects description
- [`01.blinking_light`](https://github.com/ShayanShahrabi/Arduino/tree/main/01.blinking_light)

The very first program to turn the LED near port 13 (on an arduino uno board) of the arduino ON and OFF!

- [`02.arduino_variables`](https://github.com/ShayanShahrabi/Arduino/tree/main/02.arduino_variables)

A program to get familiar with variables showing and SOS morse coded massage through turning an LED on/off!

- [`03.LED_binary_counter`](https://github.com/ShayanShahrabi/Arduino/tree/main/03.LED_binary_counter)

A binary counter, counting from 0 to 15! The image of the circuit, as well as the arduino code and the circuit in json format (if you'd like to use [Wowki](https://wokwi.com/)) are all attached in the corresponding directory.

- [`04.analog_write`](https://github.com/ShayanShahrabi/Arduino/tree/main/04.analog_write)

Up until now the codes only used digital writes, witch defines weather there is a current or not (a binary input), but now the code uses an analog write! So the input/output values can range from 0 to 255


## Rsources
- [The official book that comes with the starter kit](https://www.eitkw.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Arduino_Projects_Book.pdf)
- [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/) is an amazing platform that I've utilized for sketching. I strongly suggest exploring it! Additionally, the diagram.JSON files in every directory can be seamlessly employed on this platform to swiftly assemble the  circuits of each project.
- Most of the code here is based on this really great [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGs0VKk2DiYw-L-RibttcvK-WBZm8WLEP) by Paul Mcworthy
